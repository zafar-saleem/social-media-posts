# CTA Button

A visually stunning and highly interactive Call-to-Action (CTA) button component built for modern React and Next.js applications, featuring a sleek, customizable neon glow effect on hover.

## ✨ Features

* **Distinctive Neon Glow:** Utilizes advanced CSS `box-shadow` and `transition` properties to create a vibrant, glowing outline.
* **Interactive Hover Effect:** The neon glow subtly intensifies and animates upon hover, providing immediate and satisfying visual feedback.
* **Icon Support:** Easily accommodates leading icons (like the "Send" icon used here) to enhance context and visual appeal.
