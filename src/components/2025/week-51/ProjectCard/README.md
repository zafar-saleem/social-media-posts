# 🚀 ProjectCard - Modern UI Component

This directory contains the source code for a dynamic and visually appealing Project Card component, designed to display key metrics and timelines for a project in a dashboard or project management application.

This component was created as part of a series showcasing modern UI development techniques.

• **Interactive Milestones Timeline:** Includes a graphical representation of project phases and milestones with date markers and progress animation (as demonstrated in the accompanying video).
• **Fully Responsive:** Designed to look great on various screen sizes.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
• **React / Next.js:** The component is built using React.
• **HTML:** Semantic markup for structure.
